# Frontend Mentor - TO DO App.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Generate an application of a TO DO list, being able to generate a list of tasks that you have to perform, given that it would not contain sensitive information, it is stored in the Local Storage to be able to access it when necessary.
- Being able to switch between the three themes that the application provides, which are Dark and Light.
